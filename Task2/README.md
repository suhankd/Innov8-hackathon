# Soldier Loyalty Classification Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a model for predicting soldier loyalty based on various features related to mental health and workplace dynamics. It utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for textual data analysis and feedforward neural networks for classification.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - **CNN**: Analyzes comments to predict loyalty.
  - **Classifier**: Integrates CNN output with other features to classify soldiers as loyal or at risk of betrayal.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used in this project is the **Mental Health in Tech Survey** from Kaggle. It includes various numerical features, binary data, and textual comments.
